review1Blurb: "If the technicians who work on Android phones all day long recommend it, you know this is a decent app for technical users. The tool lets you create shortcuts--essentially, icons that can launch an app, or perform various features--to the desktop or notification tray, or create new keyboard shortcuts that launch an app."
