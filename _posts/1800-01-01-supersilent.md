aboutText: "Keep your phone silent no matter what. Other apps can't make a peep.
No need to worry about games or other apps playing a sound during a bad time. Ensures that no app can play sound while it's enabled. Apps can raise the volume or try to play but they won't make a peep.
Works with game like Angry Birds! Play on the pooper or in a meeting without anyone hearing a peep. If you get caught, I'll refund your money and you can keep the app. I will also send your boss a five sentence email if you get caught in a meeting.
New experimental feature allows you to synchronize all volumes for easy volume changing via your volume rocker. It's basically a better volume manager.
Can enable/disable using only the volume rocker or create a convenient desktop toggle."
