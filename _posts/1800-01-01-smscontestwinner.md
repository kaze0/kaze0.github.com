aboutText: "Win contests by sending the most SMS's to a number. SPAM AND WIN! This helps to automate the process.<br>
Due to a restriction in Android, you will be limited to 100 messages per hour completely automated. After that, you will need to tap a send button. The button is always in the same spot, so just tap away and win those contests.<br>
Didn't win? Request a refund within the old 48 hour limit and I'll process your refund. Sometimes it takes a few bucks to win<br>
v1.1 Bug fixes. More features!"
